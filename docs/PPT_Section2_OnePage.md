## SENSORA — Fragrance That Feels You

---

### The Problem

The same perfume smells completely different on different people.

**Why?** Individual biochemistry varies:

- Skin pH (4.5 - 6.5)
- Skin type (dry / normal / oily)
- Body temperature

**Result:** Billions spent on perfumes that don't perform as expected.

| Your Biology | Sensora's Smart Correction |
